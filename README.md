# FFA-models
Free-free absorption models for colliding wind binaries

This repository contains a file with two different FFA models for modelling the variaiton of FFA along the orbit of a CWB. The first model assumes both stars are launching spherical winds and is based on the model derived by Williams et al. (1990). The second model assumes one of the winds is anisotropic and is presented in Bloot et al. (subm.).
